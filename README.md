*CoinbaseHistoricDataToInfluxDB

A utility program that wraps the cbpro and influxdb python libraries. Its primary purpose is to provide a simple interface for downloading various historic data from coinbase and storing that data directly into influxdb databases. This allows one to pull the coinbase data into a local storage facility where it can be analyzed and manipulated more easily.
